At some point boys have to grow-up and become men.This is when I started doing my **self improvement** journey.

I've began to visit the gym **3 times** a week for a start. After some months of hard work results did came then i decided to increase my visits to 4 times a week.Today Im very pround from my decision , Im **very pround** with the physics I've managed to create, but also it gave me the ability to do something productive, It gave me **discipline** and Im planning to continue this for long period of time.

Hitting the gym is not enought of course so i decided to get rid off people that **pull me back in life** and creating new friendship with more worthy ones.What do I mean by this? People who think of **success**, who are genuily improving too, thinking about **money and business**,giving eachother respect and so on.

My behaviours toward women took change too. Most young men are trying to get laid despite being completely broke , lazy and not having anything to offer women in the long term. I understood that in order to have a good,healthy and strong relationship with the opposite sex you have to offer security - financial and physical , picking what words to say and understanding the female nature.Curently Im working out in aquiering financial independancy in order to shine before even thinking getting into any girls because men are in constant competition and I want to become the best choice.
